/**
 * Provides a LaunchDarkly team to custom role mapping resource.
 *
 * This resource allows you to manage the custom roles associated with a LaunchDarkly team. This is useful if the LaunchDarkly team is created and managed externally, such as via [team sync with SCIM](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account-security/sso/scim#team-sync-with-scim). If you wish to create and manage the team using Terraform, we recommend using the `launchdarkly.Team` resource instead.
 *
 * > **Note:** Teams are available to customers on an Enterprise LaunchDarkly plan. To learn more, [read about our pricing](https://launchdarkly.com/pricing/). To upgrade your plan, [contact LaunchDarkly Sales](https://launchdarkly.com/contact-sales/).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as launchdarkly from "@pulumi/launchdarkly";
 *
 * const platformTeam = new launchdarkly.TeamRoleMapping("platform_team", {
 *     teamKey: "platform_team",
 *     customRoleKeys: [
 *         "platform",
 *         "nomad-administrators",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * A LaunchDarkly team/role mapping can be imported using the team key:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import launchdarkly:index/teamRoleMapping:TeamRoleMapping platform_team platform_team
 * ```
